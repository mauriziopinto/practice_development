## Minute Meetings - 11.06.2018
- Dismissed old Cozmo challenge because it was too complicated
- Designed new Cozmo challenge with fewer steps based off the python script examples
- See file for updated challenge: https://github.com/mauriziopinto/practice_development/blob/master/Automation/InnovationTrack_Automation_TheCozmoChallenge_v2.pptx

## Minute Meetings - 14.05.2018
- Maurizio discussed more of Cozmo's capabilities and introduced us to the Cozmo SDK and Python scripting
- Alex created a plan of what challenge Cozmo is supposed to complete (in short: switch position of two Cubes with the help of a third cube; pass by obstacles on its way)
- Alex will further refine the details of this plan and share the tasks for each of us within the following weeks
- Everyone will install and familiarize themselves with the Cozmo SDK and Python scripting, take a good look at the API (tip: find out how to make Cozmo move and say something)
- Next Monday is a holiday. Team plans to meet for half an hour within the rest of the week
- Download and Install Cozmo SDK: http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/?_ga=2.110752960.475353412.1526303728-1348784750.1526303728

## Minute Meetings - 23.04.2018
- New link for video files: https://live-mwcc01.gatworks.net/bitrix/tools/disk/focus.php?folderId=78347&action=openFolderList&ncc=1
- Renamed PPTX for presentation and uploaded all versions to GutHub: https://github.com/mauriziopinto/practice_development/tree/master/Automation. Latest version can always be found by the date in the filename, which has the format "Innovation track - Automation_DDMMYY.pptx" (YYMMDD stands for Year/Month/Day, e.g. 180423 stands for April 23rd, 2018).
- Dirk, Christian and Alex went through the slides and cut some content from slides/videos 2 and 4. They are suggesting to cut as much text as possible from slides/videos 1 and 3 as well. Most of the bold text can remain; the non-bold text can be communicated verbally to the audience.
- Awaiting feedback from Maurizio.
